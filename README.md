## SPECIAL THANKS TO:

[Jake McCrary](http://jakemccrary.com/), a friend and coworker, from whom I shamelessly swiped all the things that make this app any good (and functional). You should check out his site and his github, especially [Backgammon](https://github.com/jakemcc/backgammon)!

[Timothy Pratley](http://timothypratley.blogspot.com/), another friend and coworker that played some clojure golf with me to make things better. He also enjoys making games and tools for free consumption. You should have a look at [Snake Lake](http://timothypratley.blogspot.com/2016/03/sente-style-multiplayer-snake-in.html)!
